  <p>In order to integrate with AWS CodePipeline, you must authorize access to the pipeline and its related artifacts.
    If you installed Jenkins on a supported Amazon EC2 instance type, such as Amazon Linux, you can install the AWS CLI and configure a profile with the required credentials.
    This is the preferred method. In all other cases, you can store AWS credentials in these fields.
    You should securely configure your Jenkins instance to use HTTPS so that these credentials are not sent unencrypted.
